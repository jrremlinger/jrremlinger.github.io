			<div>
				Hello! I am a <a href="projects.html">software/web</a> designer as well as a <a href="music.html">music</a> producer. At the age of 14 my love for programming began as I got 
				heavily interested in modding PC video games. Due to the sparse information on modding I found online I had to learn programming from the ground up and 
				teach myself how to use tha knowlege for modding, which built up a solid framework for my future programming ventures. During high school my love for programming grew 
				even more, eventually becoming one of my favorite past-times. In high school I also discovered the world of music production, and I was drawn to it from how 
				similar it feels to programming in its approach, but with a much more artistic result. By the end of high school I was en route to college for computer programming, 
				as well as signed to a music label which releases and promotes the music that I still make in my free-time.
