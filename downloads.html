			<h2>Amnesia</h2>
			<p>
				Amnesia is my C# library that is essentially my own personal helper that I use to make my life easier. Currently the only methods it has are for 
				the editing of a live programs memory. So if you figure out a static pointer address then you could use this library to easily read or write to that value. I 
				think the best feature of this project so far is it's ability to use a module with the base address which I have yet to see anyone else do, this greatly expands 
				the range of programs you can manipulate the memory of as most programs run off a module .dll and then to their pointer. As I continue programming I will most 
				likely add more functionality and other tools to the library.
